# Grammar Error Detection and Correction Using Natural Language Processing

A professional, full-stack Natural Language Processing (NLP) micro-project for detecting grammatical, spelling, punctuation, and stylistic errors in English sentences and providing contextual corrections and morphological linguistic analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end NLP pipeline for automated English grammatical error detection and correction (GEC). Designed for academic and practical demonstrations, the application combines **rule-based computational linguistics** (such as Subject-Verb Agreement, Subject-Auxiliary Inversion, and Determiner Agreement) with **statistical language modeling** (via LanguageTool) and **morpho-syntactic feature extraction** (via NLTK and WordNet).

The project features a responsive modern web dashboard, real-time error highlighting with interactive suggestions, academic POS/lemmatization inspection, and persistent SQLite telemetry.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Grammar Checker & Correction Engine**:
   - Detects grammatical inconsistencies, verb agreement errors, tense issues, missing auxiliary inversion, and typos.
   - Generates fully corrected sentences/paragraphs with original whitespace and casing preserved.
   - Provides 1-click **Copy to Clipboard**, **Check Again**, and **Clear** controls.
2. **Interactive Color-Coded Error Highlighting**:
   - Errors are highlighted directly inside the sentence with distinct visual categories:
     - 🟠 **Grammar Errors**: Subject-Verb Agreement, verb forms, question inversion.
     - 🔴 **Spelling Errors**: Typos and misspelled words.
     - 🔵 **Punctuation Errors**: Spacing, capitalization, terminal punctuation.
     - 🟣 **Style / Other**: Duplications and stylistic improvements.
   - Clicking any error opens an interactive **Error Inspector** showing the incorrect phrase, NLP rule explanation, and 1-click **Apply Fix** button.
3. **Statistical & Quality Metrics**:
   - Word count and sentence count.
   - Total errors detected and corrections suggested.
   - **Grammar Accuracy Percentage**: Calculated via $\max\left(0, 100 - \frac{\text{errors}}{\text{words}} \times 100\right)\%$.
4. **Academic NLP Analysis Inspector**:
   - **Pipeline Flow Visualizer**: Raw text $\rightarrow$ Preprocessing $\rightarrow$ Tokenization $\rightarrow$ POS Tagging $\rightarrow$ Lemmatization $\rightarrow$ Rule Processing $\rightarrow$ Output.
   - **Penn Treebank POS Tagging**: Each token tagged with its syntactic part of speech (e.g., `NNP`, `VBZ`, `PRP`, `WRB`) and plain-English explanation.
   - **WordNet Lemmatization**: Displays the dictionary root form (lemma) for every word.
   - **Syntactic & Lexical Metrics**: Lexical diversity percentage, unique words, and average sentence length.
5. **Persistent History (SQLite)**:
   - Every grammar check is automatically saved with original text, corrected text, error count, and timestamp.
   - Search/filter previous checks.
   - Detailed modal view.
   - Delete individual items or clear all history.
6. **Modern Responsive UI**:
   - Dark mode & Light mode toggle (persisted in `localStorage`).
   - Clean typography with `Plus Jakarta Sans` and `JetBrains Mono`.
   - Accessible, mobile-friendly card layout.
   - 1-click academic benchmark test cases.

## 🎓 Academic Concepts Explained

1. **Tokenization**:
   - The process of segmenting continuous text into discrete units (tokens).
   - Sentence tokenization splits running text into sentences using boundary markers (`.`, `!`, `?`).
   - Word tokenization decomposes each sentence into individual words and punctuation tokens.
2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**:
   - Syntactic categorization of each token according to its grammatical role in the sentence (e.g., Noun, Verb, Pronoun, Adjective).
   - Uses the Penn Treebank tagset (e.g., `VBZ` = 3rd person singular present verb, `PRP` = personal pronoun).
3. **Lemmatization**:
   - Algorithmic reduction of inflected words to their canonical dictionary root (lemma).
   - Unlike stemming (which crudely truncates suffixes), lemmatization considers the word's POS tag (e.g., *"playing"* tagged as a verb $\rightarrow$ *"play"*; *"was"* tagged as a verb $\rightarrow$ *"be"*).
4. **Subject-Verb Agreement (SVA)**:
   - A syntactic constraint in English requiring the grammatical number and person of the subject to match the finite verb (e.g., singular subject *"She"* requires singular verb form *"goes"*, not base form *"go"*).
5. **Subject-Auxiliary Inversion**:
   - A syntactic rule in direct English questions requiring the auxiliary verb to precede the subject pronoun (e.g., *"Where you are going?"* $\rightarrow$ *"Where are you going?"*).

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Integrate fine-tuned Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., Google T5 / BART) for complex discourse-level paraphrasing.
- Support for multilingual grammar checking (Spanish, French, German).
- Real-time keystroke grammar checking with debounced WebSocket connections.
- Export corrections report to PDF or DOCX format.
